# List of resources to learn Dutch

## Podcasts

### Short podcasts (from 5 to 15 minutes long)

- **NPO/Zapp** is the official channel from the Dutch government for kids and teenagers. They have several podcasts like [Sterke Verhalen van Super Meiden](https://www.zapp.nl/programmas/sterke-verhalen-van-super-meiden) and [NOS Jeugdjournaal](https://www.zapp.nl/programmas/nos-jeugdjournaal-podcast) shorter than 15 minutes.
- [Coldcase. De Politie Podcast](https://www.politie.nl/nieuws/2019/oktober/15/03-podcastserie-ingezet-in-jacht-op-moordenaar.html) if you are into true crime podcasts in Dutch. Episodes around 15 minutes long.
- [VICE Nederland. Te lui om te lezen](https://play.acast.com/s/teluiomtelezen). Pretty self explanatory title as it translates into Too lazy to read. Vice magazine articles in Dutch read. Usually less than 10 minutes long.
- [Een Beetje Nederlands](https://www.eenbeetjenederlands.nl/). 
- [1 Minuut]](https://weblogs.vpro.nl/1minuut/). Short stories one minute long.
- [School TV](https://schooltv.nl/). It's a documentary website for kids in which you can choose the type of content you want to watch and select the age of the viewer (therefore the level).

### Medium podcasts (around half an hour long)

- [Kleine geschiededenis, grote verhalen](https://www.openluchtmuseum.nl/kleinegeschiedenisgroteverhalenpodcast). Monthly produced by the 'Open Air Museum' (Openluchtmuseum) about Dutch History.
- [De correspondent](https://decorrespondent.nl/podcasts). Around half an hour long podcasts about politics, literature, etc. 
- Take a look at public radio. They have tons of podcasts from different topics and levels. 

### Long podcasts

- Same as last point. I'd recommend to take a look at public radio. They have a lot of podcasts.

## Youtube

- [Aan & Matig Animatie](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdyb5XxNlm6bX94U4hyusgQ). Short films (around a minute long) with politically incorrect humor. With Dutch subtitles!
- [Kudsite](https://www.youtube.com/user/Swantonboy). Sort of the same but a little bit more difficult to understand for non native speakers. It has English subtitles.
- [Nijntje](https://www.youtube.com/user/NIJNTJE). This is a kids' animation show about a cute rabbit. Very accesible level.
- [Learn Dutch with Bart de Pau](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2IYiaH8iDXjJHblQIYPAyw). With Dutch and English subtitles. My favorite playlist is the one in which he asks Dutch people about cultural differences and Dutch stereotypes. 
- [De Slechtste Chauffer van Nederland](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF2eEFSBulGMvNLuJ8QVi7Q). For those days when you don't feel like turning on your brain this is a reality show about terrible drivers. Some episodes of the TV show are available in Youtube. The "winner" of the edition becomes the worst driver in the Netherlands.

## TV

### NOS

The public broadcasting company has great news and politics shows with a neutral Dutch accent. Usually subtitles are available Besides that, there are shows like:

- [Filemon en de Complotten](https://www.npostart.nl/filemon-en-de-complotten/BV_101404802). A journalist that talks with Dutch conspiracists.
- [Andere Tijden](https://www.npostart.nl/andere-tijden/VPWON_1247337) A nice way of learning Dutch History. Reportages with old footage and interviews.
- [Zondag met Lubach](https://www.npostart.nl/zondag-met-lubach/VPWON_1250334). Dutch version of 'Last Week Tonight'.
