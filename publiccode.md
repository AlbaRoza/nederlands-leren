# Standard for Public Code compliance

This repository is set up to comply with the [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net/). It's based on a freely available [repository template](https://github.com/publiccodenet/repositorytemplate) created by the Foundation for Public Code.

The template repository contains template documents (like README, CONTRIBUTING and LICENCE) and in-line guidance on how to configure these for your project.

## About the Standard for Public Code

Meeting the Standard for Public Code helps codebases become highly reusable, easily maintainable and of high quality.

The Standard for Public Code does this by:

* setting out a common terminology for public code development
* establishing measures to help develop high quality public code
* providing guidance on how to fulfill its criteria and operationalize compliance

The Standard for Public Code is meant to be time and technology independent.

## About the Foundation for Public Code

The Standard for Public Code was created by the [Foundation for Public Code](https://publiccode.net/). We help public organizations share and adopt open source software, build sustainable developer communities and create a thriving ecosystem for public code. 

We do this through codebase stewardship. We rely on the Standard for Public Code to make sure the code we steward is high quality as well as collaboratively maintainable.
